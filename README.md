*Classes* - A blueprint for an object

*Object* - An instance of a class

*Encapsulation* - Identify the aspects of your applications that vary and separate them from what stays the same. 
If a component or module in your application is bound to change frequently, then it’s a good practice to separate this
part of code from the stable ones so that later we can extend or alter the part that varies without affecting 
those that don’t vary

So encapsulation is not  only about having private fields and getters and setters but also about isolating complexity,
   so we can deal with it separately and not affect larger parts of the application if that changes
